# Inductor_PiModel_VerilogA
This project implements a Verilog-A model of an integrated inductor using a Pi-equivalent circuit. It accounts for frequency-dependent effects like series resistance, substrate capacitance, and resistance, providing accurate impedance modeling for high-frequency simulations and inductor performance analysis.
